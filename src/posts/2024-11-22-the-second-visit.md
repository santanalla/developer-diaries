The test was submitted and I was feeling quite confident. This time I had an interview with Human Resources, and Danny where we were going to review my project. Needless to say, it all went great.

Danny had some helpful feedback, and I cleared up some doubts with human resources. But overall, I was very excited about the whole process and the position I was applying for.
