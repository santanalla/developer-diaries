This blog was created during my first week of my ATDEV's Internship Program. My first working day assignment was to learn Eleventy and show a demo of an app made in it, for the purpose of having the relevant knowledge to be able to contribute in the upcoming projects to the best of my ability.

After this week of practicing and learning Eleventy I can confidently say that I feel more than capable to put this experience into practice.

In this blog you'll find a progress journal of my experience from the first time I applied to ATDEV two years ago, up until now. It's quite a story full of hope, feelings of accomplishment, and so much more. I'll make sure to continue updating during my free time, but for now, you can head to the Home page and find all my available submissions. Hope you enjoy the read.
