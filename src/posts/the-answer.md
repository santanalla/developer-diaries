Time goes by. I almost forgot that I had applied to ATDEV. But there was hope. I got the TestGorilla invitation again! I get notified of this by the recruiter, Heidy Charles. There's a lot of good things I could say about Heidy but they wouldn't fit in a single page.

Anyway, I immediately take the test. Forgot that you had to have the camera enabled and I picked my nose while taking the test, which sure was awkward... but mistakes are to learn from. I submitted my test, and I could do for the rest of the day was daydream about "The Prophecy" actually fulfilling.
