First day working for ATDEV. I was so excited I couldn't sleep, in fact I was able to go to bed at 3:00AM. I remember putting a RedBull in the lunchbox "just in case". But surprisingly enough, I wasn't sleepy, I was just happy.

Despite how far from my house Coral Mall is, I made it there early, in fact way too early. So I just sat in the lobby waiting for Heidy. I forgot to mention also how I was pretty much sweating and feeling shy, listening to music to calm myself down. First time, don't blame me.

Heidy arrives and the first thing I notice is how hospitable she is. It's like she made my nervousness vanish and I felt at home immediately. Every time I saw a loading screen, and in my breaks, I couldn't help but text my friends telling them that today was my first day working as a Software Developer and how I great I felt. 

Since it was the first day, I mostly spent it reading the workplace policies, setting up the work profiles in GitHub, Slack, and gmail, and reading the contract. I also had a meeting with Danny where we discussed the stacks and tools that we used while working.

Then I remembered it was Friday, it was the 15th, and I was far from home... Pay Day time... did I mention it took myself two hours to get home? Well, it was worth every single second.
