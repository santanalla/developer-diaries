First day working from home since exactly one year ago. It made it even better that the day before was my mom's birthday, and she was given the next day off, which was a great plus cause I love spending time with my family even if it's just presence.

The first thing I noticed was, the breath of fresh air. I have worked from home in the past, but there was always this feeling of being in constant watch. But in ATDEV, I just felt like I was given the independence I always wanted. Like a newbie I just went ahead and texted Andres asking about the schedule for the day, and so we had a meeting at 11.

He didn't remember me but that's okay cause he has probably worked with plenty of faces in that two years timeframe. Anyway, that's how I ended up here. It all started with "Do you know Eleventy?". Which led to me learning the tool. And here we are. Making a blog with Eleventy. Hope you enjoyed it.
