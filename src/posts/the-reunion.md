Two years later...

It was August the 7th, 2024. One month away from my 5 years anniversary in my previous workplace. I was no longer working from home, I was working on site. I was burntout. Burntout of feeling like I was wasting my time, and that my efforts were for nothing, in a field I wasn't planning to stay in (Customer Service). Being on site made it much harder to search for places to apply to.

I had a lot at stake also. A great schedule (7am-6pm, Monday to Thursday), Top Performer, and a bunch of friends. But I couldn't take it anymore. So I had to do it. I quit, so I could actually focus on finding a job in Software Development. It was hard. Very hard. I cried. Many times I regretted my choice, due to the things that I lost, specially my coworkers. But it had to be done.

Lucky for me, me and my friends had a trip to Jarabacoa scheduled on that weekend. Which was a great way to let go off the initial shock before focusing on the job hunt.

This time however, I didn't casually stumbled upon ATDEV. Instead I remembered that interview with Andres, which motivated me to re-apply, so I did. And after doing so I immediately told my mom about the whole "I hope we can meet again" and how it would've been so "poetic" to end up getting an offer and actually taking it. I got the email from Andres confirming that my application was received. Now it was just a matter of waiting...
